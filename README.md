# Brain-Tumor-Classification
This Repository gives an in-depth understanding of the Convolutional Neural Networks and image processing. Here we have used Transfer Learning as well to optimize model training time and cost. Also, Transfer Learning helps in using the previously trained values of neural networks when there is a scarcity of data. 

This repository achieves an accuracy of around 96% ~ 98%. This accuracy can be pushed further by developing more layers along with data. 

However, the amount of data is not enough here hence we use the previously learned weights to develop the Neural Network.
